positive,The laughs continue!,Season Four of this comedy is just as good as the previous three. I love this show and wished it would have gone on forever.
positive,Picture quality.,"I don't know if I was unlucky with my copy, but the picture quality is not up to standard, often somewhat blurred. Close-ups are okay, but generally this doesn't compare with other series I've bought from the same era.Having said that, the series itself is both humorous and thrilling."
positive,Havahart 5350 deer repellent,"The Electronic deer repellers do help. I have noticed a dramatic reduction in damage to the flora in my yard, but not a complete ellimination of problems.I live in a wooded area with a high deer population, so I don't think anything would totally elliminate the deer problem.Nothing is perfect in life, so I am happy with the improvement these devices have produced."
positive,Nice product very nice performance,This is a very good product with excellant performance. Picture quality is also very good. This product is mainly used by my son in his room and he plays video and X-Box and never has any complaint.
positive,Looks good and no odor,"Despite sometimes taking a week or so to empty its contents, we haven't had any problems with odors. The charcoal filter seems to do the trick. We've been using it for a few months now, so I can't say how long it will last, but there's no noticeable wear and tear yet. Another reviewer mentioned rust, so I rinse it and allow it to dry completely after I empty it. Looks good also."
negative,"Terrible read, but lots of information","This book has a lot of great information and an interesting analysis of what was behind the hysteria. However, it's not very readable. I cannot understand why Norton can't take a quote and tell it in her own words. The multiple quotes in nearly every sentence, and in Old English, made reading this book like watching paint dry. On the other hand, it's a great tranquilizer: I fell asleep several times reading it."
positive,richard marcinko rogue warrior,"A good book for military buffs. It's hard to say what is real or fiction in next book,but he says he did it all in this one. Made me laugh out loud more than once.Marcinko goes into great detail of characters."
negative,No extra features? What's the point?,"It would be nice if Disney took the lead of other companies and put extra features on their DVD Discs. New Line, Warner Bros. even Universal have gotten into the act and have made mass profits by taking the extra time to put extra features in the discs (i.e. trailers, ""Making of"" Documentaries, Deleted Scenes, Pencil Tests, etc.) A good example of an animated film with extras was ""Quest for Camelot"". If Disney is going to release these discs, but not put any extras on it and charge *full* price for them, why release them at all??? :-("
positive,good book,"This is an awesome book. Could have gone into a little more detail with the bat, seal, ect. I would recommend this to anyone who is doing anatomy or art."
positive,The perfect read,"J.K. has already made history a thousand times over and in Harry Potter's first outing it's abundantly clear as to why. This book strikes the perfect balance for humor, adventure, suspense, and even budding romance (Hermonie and Ron). If you're the one of the last two people who haven't read this book, don't cheat yourself another day. Give in, read it. This book's hype is well deserved."
negative,no stars at all,"I've got a cjpy of this album occasionally for free and when I put it on my player I prayed that I haven't spent a penny on it. Two full length disks - and no remarcable songs at all. Why is it called hits? xcept maybe 'Hey Little Girl' most of the selections are NOT hits. They look like songs of category even not B or C ... really - it's Y and Z, performed at junior school contest. Of course Bravo is teen's label... but not to such an extend ... Printing such CDs is a waste of plastic. There are more valuable disks in the stores now..."
positive,Picture Of A Rising Star,"Lee Morgan was still a youngster when he recorded this album, but you'd never know it. His star was ascending, and this recording captures him during a period when his technical ability, artistic sensibility and youthful exuberance were all present in equal parts. The result? A beautiful album by a trumpete player celebrating his gift with a solid backing band. The perfect introduction to Morgan's music, it stands on its own, highlighting his jazz roots, before he explored his funkier side on albums such as ""Cornbread."""
positive,Great Machine,"The Delta 50-760 is everything the manufacture claims. I've used it primarily at my woodturning lathe. Dust in the air has been eliminated. Heavier chips still land on the floor, but not as many, so cleanup is much easier. The machine was packaged exceptionally well. It went together easily. One minor problem with the instruction book: The book says that all you need is a 12mm wrench and a Phillips head screwdriver. Right off the bat, a 14mm wrench was needed to attach the casters, and a thin one at that. It took a few minutes to improvise a thin wrench, and that took up most of the hour it took to complete the assembly. Those casters can't be tightened down with a regular wrench. A special wrench should be supplied in the box. Overall, I am very pleased with the product.Delta 50-760 1.5 Horsepower 1,200 CFM Vertical Bag Dust Collector, 120/240-Volt 1 Phase"
positive,Great product--I've worn the feet off of mine,"My wife and I both use these with our laptops and love them. It works with any computer that has USB, and has no batteries to run down, so it's always ready. I've had mine for 2 years, and am about to replace it because I have literally run the feet off of it--the little nylon pads on the bottom have worn down to the point that it sort of scrapes when it moves. I am surprised to see the negative reviews about the cord, because I have had no problems at all. You need to be reasonably careful when retracting the cord so that it doesn't bunch up, but it seems very sturdy. I carry mine in a backpack where it gets jostled around with a bunch of other gizmos, and it continues to work perfectly. I used to think a wireless mouse was the ultimate for mobility, but those have 2 problems: 1) batteries; 2) most of them come in 2 parts, so if you lose one, the whole thing stops working. This mouse has neither of those issues."
positive,My opi√±ion,"This was a good mobie my favorite part was when in the beginning when she has packing her books to go to cabin in the first scene my other favorite part in the first scene was when a big murman made love with Jenny. My second favorite scene happened when the man with the saw hit him and all and all i think three good discribing words for this movie was for this film heartattack, chilis, and government corupption. if u like a big plot twish with glob of poopoo when you watch it watch it with a friend [ : have your friend coop pasta first make pasta in a medium sized pan with salt and oliveoil and maybe pestofind the secret message aboveif you do not like this and share with 150 people the movie wIlL haPApEPn tzO you in REAl LIFETHiS REallY WORKS"
positive,lyrical piano virtuousity,the glass-close portrait is achingly beautifully played. a discrete and warm miracle
positive,"Be aware this is ""bedding"" and not a bed.","I purchased this set thinking it was some sort of child's bed and what arrived was bedding - two entirely different things. The items are quality and lovely, but not what it says on the label. A more appropriate label would be ""Gossamer 4-Piece Toddler Bedding Set."" It would cause less confusion."
positive,I love Mandalay,Nicola Hitchcock's voice is amazing.Check out their website...for sample audio tracks and to view some music videos. Mandalay and Garbage are my favorite groups. Mandalay's music is La Femme Nikita-ish since it is a very classy fusion of electronia and trip-hop.
negative,Total crap..buyers beware,I bought this unit and thought will be good. It took 13 min to heat up a simple sandwitch and then entire outer surface gets heated so much. And it never worked after one time use. Had to return the product. Was very disappointed.
negative,One word: disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Demille but this was his worst effort, in my opinion. A plot too unbelieveable to even consider, a confusing mass of characters and not among them, anyone you particularly care about. Disappointing Demille."
negative,Not as expected,"I bought the game for $19.99...thinking that a brainless game would be a good break from thinking games. I mean it's Whac-A-Mole...how hard can it be? Because it's computerized, you get gold moles (more points), hairy moles (sucks points away), etc. There aren't ""in game"" instructions, so you have to keep the book nearby. Overall, I'm just not impressed...I wanted a chance to beat on some moles, not have to read a book in order to play. I could only figure out a couple of things on my own.Gameplay ends quickly if you don't read the book. Moles don't go away on first hit all the time (unless you hit the screen harder). I wonder about the long term effects that could have on the life of your Nintendo DS.I tried to get rid of the game at Game Stop a couple of days later...they are offering $2. I'll give it to a friend, hopefully her kids will have more fun with it."
positive,Way better than I thought it was going to be!!!,"Way better than I thought it was going to be!!! really great comedy with some drama mixed in. it's not enough to call it a chick's flick, so i suggest it."
negative,Returned,"It was an artificial wood. Where was the ""Beauty of solid oak with unsurpassed quality"" as described in the product description?"
positive,A TIGHT GOSPEL CD!!!!!,"I first heard this anointed singer/musician at a leadership conference in Richmond,Va serval years ago. She was the minister of music at this conference and was so anointed. Everytime when we rehearse the songs for the concert, God was giving her new songs that was flowing within her. I'm a musician myself but i was blown how she would play the piano. She was hitting chords i never heard of. One song she did i will never forget was I'm Saved. The drummer on this Cd, one of the tighest drummers on the east coast. Big Up's to Boo! I went ODU for one year and i was in the schools gospel choir and he was the drummer. This cat got mad skills."
negative,I was really looking for the English translation of this book,Because I do not understand Spanish...I was really hoping to find the English Translation of this book...so I am a bit disappointed with this.
positive,The Donna Reed Show: The Complete First Season,"Great, once again I love the innocence of shows like this. I strive to be a decent person, like the characters on these shows. They do teach us."
positive,"Ease to use, great cost-benefit, sound quality good, most of the times","Good sound quality most of the times, but closer to bigger cities get some interference, sometimes annoying. But, for the price you pay it is a great cost-benefit. Very easy to use."
positive,"great music, unique booklet","Peter Schat's 60 minute opera summerizes in musical form the eternal quest of man for a world better than the one he knows. The music is ephemeral, lasting and constantly doing away with certainties. The booklet is spectaculat, allowing the listener to follow the music picture by picture. The best in its genre."
negative,A Poor Effort,"As a fan of Bruce Wilkerson (having used some of his other material), I am very disappointed with this effort. Bruce should know better. Exhorting Christians to copy one of the most self-centered prayers of a tragic Old Testament character, is a mistake. That the book has commercially prospered and spawned an entire 'Jabez' franchise in our shallow, self-centered, Christian pop culture is hardly a surprise. The theology represented in this book will only fly in propserous Western cultures. The book appeals to the absolute worst element in all of us . . .""how to get the 'secret' key to prosperity"". The Prayer of Jabez is little more than warmed over, self-improvement, pop psychology dressed in Christian lingo. Avoid this book. If you want self-improvement, get the real thing and buy from Tony Robbins or Dale Carnegie."
positive,Works Perfectly!,"Works great. It was easy to assemble and holds many ties. I wish the quality of the plastic was a little better, but it does the job nicely. Recommend to cluttered closets everywhere!"
positive,A beautiful treatise on space and simplicity,"I loved this book. I think that anyone who is building or remodeling can benefit from these elegant, creative, warm designs that use space, light, and location so well. In an age where everyone is madly chasing after ""more, more, more,"" it's refreshing to see so many examples of how ""less is more""---when it's done right."
negative,WHAT WAS THIS TRYING TO SAY?!!!!!!,"The first 50 pages or so it was really good, but beyond that point it got really slow and it just didn't make any sense and doesn't get to the point well enough. I felt that Toni could've done a lot better and should have been. I wouldn't recommened this book to any one. It's not worth the time or the effort to try to understand it."
positive,the essential frank sinatra,it came before they said it would. it came in good condistion i am very happy with this company
positive,This is the best book I'v read,The Forgotten was the first Animorphs book I'v read and now I want to read them all.
positive,"i love this tape ,great work out I think its one of his better videos","I think I am in good shape , but I found that this video its pretty hard , its a challenge its none stop .What i like about it that you work every muscle .good choice"
positive,Life Saver!!,"I love these diaper-like liners!! I put them on top of the plastic liners. I didn't know how great these were until I run out of them and my cats(I have two) started to pooping around. With these liners, I don't have to change the litter for over 3 weeks."
positive,Great sleepsack,I love the material. My baby loves this sleepsack. The material washes great and is very warm and cozy. Highly recommended.
negative,"Cap was busted, taste was awful","I ordered a bottle of this based on a recommendation, for its health benefits, and instructed to put it in my morning protein smoothie. The person who recommended it also swore I wouldn't be able to taste it in my smoothie. Unfortunately, they were wrong. It completely ruined the smoothie with it's funky, almost grassy/plant-like taste. I couldn't finish the smoothie and I don't think I'll even attempt to use it in anything else. To top it off, my bottle arrived with the cap busted. I won't be purchasing this again."
positive,it was pretty good,"I really liked the plot of this book, but it was a little confusing because they have many scenes going on at the same time. The book is about a speech teacher trying to teacher a deaf person to speek and lip read. The topic is really interesting, because I haven't really read a lot of plays about the deaf, and the struggles that they go through. There is also a big romance in the book, but I think that the romance moves a little too quickly, and in that way is unrealistic. The play is in 2 short acts. I really liked the notes from the author in the beginning about the struggle to write this play because of a deaf friend, and about how it was put on in a small theater and then moved to broadway, and then it won a tony for best actress & actor, and best play! I suggest that you read it because it brings up a lot of interesting issues!"
negative,i thought it would be better,The dvd seemed to be of poor quality especially for the price. The documentary also was not what i expected. It left me with alot of questions unaswered..I would not recommend it.
positive,One of Two Must Own Collection of Short Stories,"The other is Neil Gaiman's Fragile Things. I know this may seem odd to have O'Connor, the genius of revealing the inner workings of the human, beside Gaiman, but if you read Gaiman the connections are there. I'm all about getting readers from different disciplines and genres to connect with other fields. O'Connor's work, as most know, is as perceptive as it gets. Reading her work is a pure revelation, an ongoing epihpany as to what makes humans human (especially the southern religious human). Read, re-read and enjoy."
positive,"Proud, happy Cube owner","I am a proud, happy owner of 2 apple Cubes ... This one as well as a tricked-out model with 1.5 GB of Ram, a 1.5 Ghz G4 processor and a 160 MB hard drive.Regardless of the stats, the cube has to be one of the most amazing pieces of industrial design ever created ... and it is a Mac (of course) to boot!I haven't had any trouble with either of my Cubes ... and I would suggest that everyone gets one before they become real-collectable items!"
negative,Expensive and unclear,"This book is sucha collasal waste of money. The ideas presented are very basic, but the authors are rather daft and manage to confuse readers even on simple concepts. Much of the stuff any normal person with average IQ would be able to understand reading investopedia. The book is a typical MBA book - dumbed down, glossy and expensive."
positive,A decent average quality sheet.,"This sheet feels a little stiff when you first take it out of the package but it softens up a bit when you wash it. Don't expect an extremely soft sheet; it is about average, but, for the price it isn't bad. Also, unlike many people I prefer the cotton/poly mix in my sheets because they don't wrinkle nearly as bad as pure cotton.I would recommend this sheet to all but the most fussy sleepers."
positive,"Cobol, it's alive and kicking","It is a good book and an educational video. Especially the reassuring words in lesson 1 gives a Cobol-Dinosaur like me, some hope for the future. I have been developing in Cobol for about 25 years. Beside Cobol, I have also developed in Basic and have made several utilities for MultiEdit, which programming language is almost identical to C++. Starting with RM/Cobol, migrating to Microfocus Cobol and I made the last Cobol-manufacturer's (dialect-) move 10 years ago to ACU-Cobol. Halfway the second lesson in the video I was eager to try VisualStudio in combination with Netcobol. So that is a good sign. This book gives a clear picture of the bridge between Fujitsu-Cobol and .NET.Keep up the good work, Howard!"
positive,Gogo brown rice bowls excellent taste and time saver,"I use the rice bowls as a time saver. They microwave in 1.5 minutes and have an excellent taste and consistency -- just as good as my Whole Foods brown rice when cooked 45 minutes. I find this produce adds a lot to my life -- I have one for dinner almost every day -- whole grains with no mess, no fuss. I recommend this product highly."
positive,If you love comedy,"If you love comedy, you should like this movie. Very funny. Most video stores no longer carry this movie, was thrilled to hvae found it at Amazon."
positive,A new perspective,"I enjoy American short stories, and I feel that reading this book opened my eyes to new perspectives. For example, I had not thought about the relationship between Asian and Latino immigrants in the 1940's. The themes are fresh and varied and it's possible to read the stories in whatever order suits you."
positive,Retro but cool,"This is an old book, but it is a great one. My daughter always loved making the cranberry bread for our family even though she would never eat it herself!"
negative,Not good at all - Get the Conze (1959) edition,"DO NOT buy this text! The scriptures are not organized in anywhere near the intuitive fashion as the Conze version, and it is missing a whole host of sutras, most notably, EVERYTHING about the conversations between King Milinda, and the Bodhisattva, Nagasena, which are absolutely critical in any study of Buddhism. Lopez's rambling and unhelpful inter-locutions throughout the text are distracting and unhelpful, and really break up the blow of what little original text he didn't butcher. Seriously, buy the 1959 edition by Conze and you will be much happier."
positive,"good story, lots of action","Good story-line, likeable characters, lots of action. What more do you need from good sci-fi? Ends with the possibility of a sequel."
positive,Mirrors help.,"We bought these to put on our 97 Dodge Ram for towing our fifth wheel,,, they are a decent mirror for the money, we did add a little bit of foam inside the cavity to help the mirrors stabilize, but for the money it's a very good purchase."
positive,Collogeuge of Old artists performing at Christmas,"I bought this to watch old Christmas type shows. Contains many great artist performing together like noone today. Great to watch during the holidays as a treat.The entertainment is very different from what this generation is use to,oh,well great to watch and share."
positive,Marble Wine Jackets Work,"Serving Temperature is one of the factors that affects the taste of wine andis under your control. Tools that help you control serving temperature add to your pleasure. A marble wine jacket will keep wine that's been previously brought to its best temperature at that temperature for about the length of time that it takes for two or more diners to finish it.Marble jackets are better than ice buckets because they don't lead to all that annoying dripping. They are less versatile than the silver or printed sleeves that you can store in the freezer and use when you carry wine to a restaurant or host's home. On the other hand, they are less ugly and even fit right in with some table decor.Lynn Hoffman, author of New Short Course in Wine,The,and the properly chilled bang BANG: A Novel"
negative,antisemitic trash,"Perhaps Turgenev was reflecting the prejudices of his day, but the story of the Jew is highly antisemitic -- and distasteful. Had I known of its content, I would never have downloaded it."
negative,...the entire book is printed upside down,"So i received my copy and it's fine, aside from the fact that the entire thing is printed upside down. Now whenever I'm reading out of it for my class people look at me like I'm an idiot :oD I do find it funny that when you open it, it proudly says ""PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"" upside down on the first page."
negative,Disappointed,"I am a big fan of renaissance instrumental music, and since these are dances, I was expecting some pleasant, spirited melodies, like on the excellent English Country Dances. Although there are several tracks like this on this CD, many are slow and dirgy. These, combined with the tracks with soprano vocals, make one feel as if they were in church, which is not a bad thing, if that's what you're looking for."
positive,Good product & tech support,"The item works as expected, tech support is very helpful. the problem i had is getting the plate to seal on the vintage style master cylinder. the chains & clamps wont work you will have to use a couple of c-clamps to get a good seal & even it is difficult. I believe if you were using this item on a modern master cylinder that is attached with the screw seal then it would not leak. Motive tech support is helpful & will advise the customer of the work arounds for this item."
positive,This is amazing!,"People are just not appealed to something that they're not used to, such as Evanescence with a classical twist. It being a big classical twist, but, whatever! It's truely amazing to hear all the parts done by a quartet. True musicians such as myself honestly appreciate this beauty."
negative,horrrrrrrrrible,Follow the leader is okay if its your first korn but korn and life is peachy are worth listening to.This sucks bad do not buy it if you like Freak On A Leash And Got The Lie those are good songs.But The Rest just plain sucks. Get The singles Got The Life and Freak On A Leash unless you don't mind wasting your money!!!!!!!!!
positive,TBI family survivor,After reading this book I was so greatful for the excellent care hospitals now give.I am also thankful for all this family has done.
positive,Not Just for Children,"I love this CD and have no children. The music on this CD is very soothing and wonderful to listen to, for anyone interested in listening to beautiful music. It's very nice to listen to in the car, and I didn't fall asleep!"
positive,A superb introduction to analysis,"It is not really possible to add anything to the many positive reviews already here, so I will reaffirm the fact that Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis is indeed the best book from which to learn basic analysis. While it is not an easy book to learn from, it forces you to really know the subject and be able to think for yourself."
positive,Good as the First,"My son had played this game before we bought it. He enjoys it as much as the first. Thing I like about it is there's plenty of free play - once you beat the game there's still plenty to do, making it a tad easier on the wallet."
positive,Serviceable Ceiling Hook,"I wanted a hook to hold a suspended Tiffany style lamp over the center of the dining table on my new screened porch. The hardware store types were unsuitable, so I did what I always do when I can't find what I want--go to Amazon.com The hook isn't exactly stylish but it beats the hardware store hooks by a mile."
positive,super light weight,"decent, good looking stroller for the cost - one of the lightest out there. i've had no trouble opening it with the snap of one hand while holding my son in the other. per the other reviews, do not get this stroller for the ipod feature, you can barely hear it - also the toddler tray is way too high and my front wheels squeak a bit even after applying wd40, but for the cost, weight, comfort and looks, it was exactly what I was looking for."
negative,good charlotte is just pop trying to be punk,this is the 2nd worst band in the world behind simple plan. this song is awful and it makes me wanna throw up. this is just a pop band that all the teen girls say is punk. if you want real punk music you should get Offspring's Ignition. that albums spits on this pop trash.
positive,great music at a great price!,"Many years ago... I bought and enjoyed the album ""Urubamba"". Some years later, I bought this album to satisfy my craving for more Andean flute music. I was initially a little disappointed; the production quality is not up to the level set by Urubamba and the style is less ""polished and refined"". But it grew on me.In recent years, I began searching again for more such music, and found the groups Inkuyo and Sukay. And here on Amazon, I came across this CD (my album is long gone)... as soon as I heard the first track sample, it all came back, and I realized I now like this CD as much as the ""polished and refined"" sound of Urubamba (not that I wouldn't buy an Urubamba CD in a heartbeat, but I can't find it anywhere!). Yes, this CD is less polished, but it maintains a high energy level and has equally good musicianship, with a style that is more spontaneous and carefree (IMHO). At this price I think this is an excellent buy, and I recommend it highly."
negative,Not a buy book,"After reading this! From Front to back. I would rate this in my opition as a not buy! Its a 3rd edition: copy write 1993. This book has not kept up with changes in the eletronics field. Since 1993. It devotes a whole chapter on using a oscilloscope. Which uses the older type scopes. It has a whole chapter. On volt meters. Which is out of date. This field has widen on the type of meters in the market now. The first thing I did notice was the illustration. (No color or B & W pictures) Which, where a little cartoonist looking. It has a chapter on testing TVs. On using the old picture tube with vacuum tubes. On page 194 it shows a illustration on building your own Vaccuum tube tester. If you can find a TV that still uses tubes. It also has a page on 185 on testing Phono Cartridges with a scope. It does talk about IC near the end of the book."
negative,Crap live set song selection shows why Y & T never made it big.,"There are two and 1/2 good songs here; Meanstreak and Hurricane rock, Black Tiger starts to rock but gets tedious. Everything else is either a crap ballad, an obscure album track, or a lame repeat 4 words ad naseum excuse for a song. The 10 album has great songs, hard times is NOT one of them. Nothing from Contageous, no lipstick and leather, nothing from Down For the Count. And nobody wants to hear anything from the first two albums. Poor live song selection and chosing the worst song from an album to be the single, are why Y & T never made it big. Can't say whether this is what they sound like live because every show where Y & T were an opening act that I had tickets for Dio, Yngwie, Y & T never bothered to show up. A band that never really cared and it shows."
negative,I respectfully disagree.,"I thought this movie was slow. I understand why screenwriters make characters make stupid decisions, so that they can explore the resulting mayhem, but I thought this main character would have been smart enough not to be so dumb. This film is not one iota as good as ""Better Luck Tomorrow.""I was shocked years ago when I saw Russell Wong playing a character that had a long, classic, hair queue. In this film, Russell is a dyed blond and yes, it looks a hot mess! Clearly, they wanted him to imitate one of the villains in ""Rush Hour 1."" This film lacked subtitles of any language. I'm disappointed."
positive,"No ""Psychic Paper Wallet"" included and overpriced.","I just purchased this product under the impression it came with the ""Psychic Paper Wallet"" and payed 29.99 for this. The same product is advertised on this same site for 19.99 without the Wallet. Why would I pay 10$ more for the same thing? VERY misleading images and reviews on this product, unless you just want the screwdriver and want to pay more money. All that being said it is a very fun item to have and the seller has contacted me in regards to the confusion. Check the dates on these reviews, the Psychic Paper wallet version is discontinued and does not exist on this site."
negative,Weak suction,"Maybe something is wrong with my vac, but the suction powerful is extremely weak. I can barely pick up human hair... Very disappointed."
positive,Frozen Yogurt Maker,Love this device!! Makes great frozen yogurt in a fraction of the time with NO MESS and NO SALT.
negative,"overated, unengaging story","I'm really surprised at the high reviews.On the positive side, IRIA has some interesting character design and atypical elements of science fantasy. Plus the DVD is about 180 minutes long.On the negative, IRIA is unengaging and more action than story or character based. I found myself bored, and quickly not caring what was going on.There's nothing particularly special about the animation, though it does feature some nicer background paintings. Hold frames of IRIA are drawn better than most. IRIA pales in comparison to GHOST IN THE SHELL, ARMITAGE III, NINJA SCROLL, GIANT ROBO, and even THE BIG O, in my opinion.A rental, at best."
negative,Hilarious! Fantastic bathroom literature!,I've heard about this book for years and recently inherited a copy. Can remember when it was being distributed to and by the churches where I grew up in the 70's. The author lives in a fantasy world accentuated by his own dementia! I'm only vaguely familiar with many of the groups mentioned within yet can recognize dozens of outright errors. Even sadder is that someone on Amazon is trying to sell it for over $100. Never pay more than $2 for it unless you can steal it...
positive,Simple and elegant espresso,"Too many words would ruin the simplicity and elegance. It simply makes delicious espresso, quickly and with a minimum of effort. Cleans up in about 2 minutes...I take mine camping.The ""cup"" ratings are for small, traditional sized espresso cups. If you like to pour a mug full of espresso, then divide the cup rating by 4 to arrive at an approximate size for your ""machine"". My nine cup maker gives me 2 full sized mugs of rich coffee. For you ""crema"" people...there is none.It is inexpensive, relative to plug in type machines, so it is as nearly a risk free purchase as you can make. Enjoy."
positive,Non-Fiction,"This is a rerelease of the first 2 Non-Fiction cds plus a few bonus tracks. We didn't make a penny on this rerelease, but I STILL want you to buy it! I think my favorite song is, ""Reason To Die"" although it never went over well live, so we rarely played it. You can search out videos for The My Way, In The Know and Reason To Live on YouTube plus our heaviest song, ""Peaked"". If you loved Non-Fiction check out THE CURSED my band with Blitz from Overkill. I also have 3 solo cds...and a brand new ""Best of"" coming out in the fall of 2008. Dan"
positive,Superb!,"Excellent summary information on the Valley of the Kings, presented in a concise and coherent format with lots of correlated information. I do not fully agree with the conclusions drawn about KV55, but this does not detract from the value of the book as a whole."
negative,Unreadable,"I had never read anything by Julianna Baggott prior to my unfortunate encounter with The Madam. I certainly won't bother with anything else she's written. I find it appalling that a writer who, according to information on the book jacket, has written both prose and poetry for various reputable publications, not only has a generally poor grasp of English grammar, but is unaware that ""noisome"" means ""putrid"" or ""malodorous,"" and not ""noisy,"" which is what, based on the context in which the word appears, Baggott clearly assumed it meant. And did anyone bother to PROOFREAD this book for such malapropisms--as well as its numerous grammatical inaccuracies? If the usage in this novel is a reflection of what is happening generally to the English language, then we are in serious trouble. Prose like this is, as far as I am concerned, unreadable by a truly literate public."
positive,Defending this book,"I recently purchased this book before having read any on-line reviews. After getting through the first 47 pages I believe it to be a great book and don't understand all the negative criticism. I have only been around javascript about three months now and have been using two other books (one of which is a totally useless visual quickstart book that is only good if you wish to copy the code and not learn a darned thing!!!)and believe this book is easy to digest. Any javascipt book takes some time to absorb (however, still avoid the quickstart book!!!) Take it slow and read carefully and do the exercises. Good luck."
positive,Another winner by Ms. Coel,This series by Ms. Coel is refreshing because the main characters are not perfect people. They are just like us with doubts and failures and struggles to deal with while solving crimes too. Excellent story telling and the Native American/southwestern flavor is a plus.
positive,A story of triumph!,"Unbelievable story of life's cruelty inflicted upon an individual, only to turn things around against all odds. Great story. A true story of triumph."
negative,Not good,It is very sturdy and fit my Milwaukee Miter saw with ease... My issue is I have only had this product for 3 weeks and its rusting.. This concerns me will this product fail quickly?
positive,"If your're new to Johansen, this is a great story to start with!","This was my first Johansen novel, and I promise it will not be my last. I wouldn't recommend it for reading in public, though, for it is filled with passionate scenes that will make the prudes blush! It is best embraced late at night before bed. It is a unique blend of history, mystery and romance. Johansen has a unique skill for developing characters with depth; they draw you in, and leave you feeling the story's end has come to soon.The plot surrounds a coveted statue, the ""Wind Dancer"", and the effects it has on those who have, and those who want it. The novel is short, but definitely worth it. You will not put it down."
positive,Pink forever,"No mistake with Pendaflex... good product... but so hard find... in pink... so so rare... For all those pink lovers out there, you'll be happy!"
positive,You should see his new stuff...,"This book is good, but his latest work is much more powerful. You can read some of his latest poems at his site, http://www.duanesposito.com"
positive,treats,"very good treats for your dog, they are soft and small, good to put pills in and my dog loves them!!!"
positive,Really helped with 'burning' sensation in my feet,"I have been taking this for about 4 weeks now, and I've noticed that the burning sensations I was getting on the bottom of my feet (especially the right) has almost disappeared. It no longer feels overwhelming at times, and I seem to have better feeling in my big toe as well.It helped some with my blood sugars, but the largest benefit for me has been in the neuropathy calming down."
positive,A wonderful album,"From beginning to end, this is a 'new-age' work of art. I have a few George Winston albums, and this is one of my favourites. He has the ability to transport you to another place and conjures up pictures in the mind...on this album, as the title suggests, forests. It is truly awe-inspiring what GW can do on the piano. This album is so much more than just ""background music"" as one reviewer suggested. It may take a few listens to really get the music in your soul, but that's always the way with good music. It begs you to listen. Highly recommended."
positive,Great,Product works great glad it came with the bolting hardware. Instructions would have helped but able to manage. One window done getting ready to order second one for other window.
negative,Doesn't Fit,"The Lenovo 40Y8725 Thinkpad Serial ATA Hard Drive Bay Adapter I received from Amzntech doesn't fit my T61. It was actually sold by meditechny thru Amzntech. It almost fits, but it's a few millimeters too high. I'm guessing the company that built it (not Lenovo, I'm sure) got the measurements a little wrong. Anyway, I'm going to try the cheaper (about $12) one, also sold thru Amzntech, but probably made by another company. I might add that it came in good time, but it didn't include an invoice with it (a possible problem with a return)."
negative,medicinal plants,"this book was interesting, names of plants were difficult even for the instructor to pronounce. I was a bit disappointed as a non- ethnobotanist major, why this book was used in an introductory class that we will most likely not ever travel to the rain forest"
positive,It works but,"This thing works but for $9 for 1, I was expecting something more durable. This thing is made from very thin plastic (as thin a paper). Being thin you have to be very careful when using it because it is easy to get damage/bent up. I would suggest searching on Google for homemade sealmate and try to make one before spending $9. As of the posting date of this review, Alba Action has a list price of 4.99 for 12 instead of $50 for 12. if you can get 12 for 4.99 I would recommend it if not you can make your own."
negative,Not what was advertised,This book wasn't the edition that it said it was. On top of that it was full of markings with highlighter and pen. The pages were in good shape except for the writing everywhere. I'm very disappointed
negative,Waste of time and money,"this game is a waste of your time and money. There only only * to buy this game:1# You get a Pikachu immediately, and don't have to catch one2# In the game you recieve a Bulbasaur, a Charmander, and a Squirtel. In the Blue/Red verisons, you have to decide between them.3# This follows the idea of the TV show.Those are the other reasons why you should buy Pokemon Yellow. Buy Crystal imstead."
negative,"For a DVD, very mediocre","Mediocre transfer. Have seen VHS tapes quality and broadcast tv that were much better. Appears that they simply transferred an old VHS copy to DVD. The narrator's voice comes out of the left speaker only, faintly from the right. Virtually no surround effects, no natural sounds and only music and the man's voice. Very disappointing since the sceneries were beautiful shots."
positive,Good DVD,"Good DVD...wasn't expecting to hear swearing, but fortunately it only says a couple of swear words throughout the whole thing..arrived fast and in great shape..Thanks :-)"
positive,"When you see a tail hanging out of dogs mouth, it looks real!","The dog really likes these (squeaker in each one).WARNGIN: When your dog is carrying one of them around in their mouth with just the tail hanging out, it looks like she really has some rodent in her mouth! Kinda freaks me out sometimes, (not because I'm scared of rodents, I'm not really scared of anything.. well maybe spiders.. and really old people behind the wheel)"
negative,I tried,"I tried but couldn't read this. What arrogance! Schlessinger considers herself blunt without realizing the difference in directness and haughty meanness, or the difference is what is right and her own self-righteousness."
negative,Hit And Miss,"This third volume is just not as appealing as the first two were. The strong hooks aren't there, the pop sensibility isn't either. Too many of these sides are forgettable."
negative,Shameful,"Do not waste your money. These sheets are rough, scratchy and see through. My son had a Nemo themed room so we purchased these sheets. what a waste of money. It is very sad that something so loveable and pricey is made so poorly. I would recommend getting the Nemo comforter which is well made and buying a set of comfy sheets."
negative,Ouch!,I like other Cellex C products and always thought a slight stinging just meant it was strong and effective. But the strenghth of this was alarming! It warns it is not for sensitive skin but they eye area in general is delicate. After two uses I was left with hard burned patches under my eyes which went away within a week. I do not have very sensitive skin. If you want industrial strenth eye cream this may be for you but for everyone else I'd say avoid it.
positive,Great Deal!!,The battery was shipped quickly and packaged great. The battery works great and we got an awesome deal on it!! Thanks!
positive,Learning to make rocks?,IF your learning to color rocks this is great. It showed me a lot. Well worth the price. I loved it. And it wasn't that badly priced.
positive,SIMPLY THE BEST,"I believe there is no equal in the industry to the ridged unequaled brute strength of Dewalt products. That is just one of the reasons that make this product so cool. These bags are equiped with all the pockets and pouches you can dream of and will ever need in the toughest most brutal lines of work. They are realy a great investment if you need and depend on the things you spend your green on, not to mention they look tough."
negative,The Dreamer's Guide to Money Loss,This is a fun read of very dangerous thinking. Check the Attorney General of Ohio's website.
positive,What a help,This book was truly a great help. I needed some ideas for the designs of my monthly newsletter. I am not a creative guy so this book was very helpful!
negative,"cheap, fake???","I received the item and it worked perfectly fine for a month, then it suddenly stopped working...It overheated by itself and won't charge my computer. The cord is perfectly fine too. Feels cheap and I don't think it's the official toshiba charger. It has three prongs and requires a surge protector. I would not recommend this charger"
positive,Memorex floppy disks/file box,"I really like this product because I raise dogs and I can put each dog on with different colored disks and just look for the color and its easier to find instead of looking and looking through all my black floppies to find the right one.Thanks again,Karon"
negative,it reloaded too many times,"I was disappointed with this purchase. If I pay to stream a specific movie, I expect it to play all the way through without ""skipping"". If I want low quality, I'll get a VHS."
negative,Really poor version,"This has been the worst, yet most expensive, text book I have purchased so far in Grad School. It is blurry, the fonts larger than size 12 bleed together. It looks like a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy. I am surprised a publisher would sell this edition."
positive,Take a chance on this book it's a sure bet!,I read this author's first book and very much enjoyed it but wanted to read another before getting excited. I am now officially excited. The plot was good and the cast were people I liked and could care about. Like her first offering I was sorry to see it end.Pick this up as well as her first book so you can enjoy the beginning of a big successful career. This writer is going to be big.
negative,mio heart rate watch,"The strapless feature is still a plus, but compared to other mio watches I have purchased for just a slightly higher price, this is an inferior product."
negative,I feel sorry for the author so that's why it's a 2 star,"The Green Book was a rather short book with a weak , unrealistic and childish plot. I am sure that a younger person such as a 7 or 8 year old might enjoy it more than i did because it has alot of stuff that only kids would enjoy. I would give it a one but i gave an extra star to the author who spent their time writing this book even when they could be doing something much more productive. Here is my bit of advice: Save your money (your local library might come in handy here)"
negative,Not a big fish fan,"I don't have any words of wisdom as to why I didn't like this movie. I just couldn't get ""into"" the characters, or the movie itself. It was really slow moving. Half way through it I turned it off. I was really disapointed because I had heard it was really good, but to me it was a waste of money."
positive,Never Falls Off!,"My Bradley instructor suggested this breastfeeding pillow and I have to say it was perfect for me. It stayed in the correct position throughout the feedings and was easily adjusted to different levels on my body as he grew in size and needed to be positioned differently. Those middle of the night feedings were so much easier because of all the support it provided me while I sat up in bed. I bought an extra cover so when he had big spit ups I could have one in the wash while using the other, that worked out great and the covers, I had the soft ones, handled being washed in the machine just fine. They came out looking new. I also had a Boppy, but only found it useful for tummy time for our son. It was an awful feeding pillow in my opinion."
negative,Awful Purchase From Wall Street Photo,The shutter does not open all the time and when I sent it back to Wall Street Photo they sent the same camera back to me again when I have asked for a refund....
positive,Where's the rest of the series?,"Hey~I read this series in 7th grade, I will now be going into 11th, and I haven't found a new book in the series! Help! I love Cherie Bennet because she tells the truth. Her newspaper column for teens used to be in my local paper, but halfway through the year they discontinued it. I was mad because I liked how she made her point, blunt and to the point. I really wish if anyone had any news on if the series ended or if there are more books that you could tell me. Thanks."
negative,"Bad, just bad...","I haven't seen anything beyond this first disc, and after seeing the first two shows I don't want to, either.The other reviewers say that it gets better in seasons 2 and 3, but it has not where to go but up. The special effects are terrible, the writing is sterile, and the lines are delivered stiffly. The characters are not remotely available, except a little bit for the girl who can read minds. All in all just a terrible show. And this is coming from a scifi fan who absolutely loves XMen - both in concept and for the actual movies.If you want to take a chance that the show gets better and want to start at the beginning - have at it. Otherwise avoid this clunker at all costs."
negative,Stop working after six month of intermidiate use!,"I would have loved to give it a 5 star...as the machine preformed well when it worked. The noise was good for us on level one, perfect on level two, loud on three. I only wish it would have lasted longer than 6months."
positive,Another tight Michael Henderson album.,"I'm sure glad i copped this one when it first became available on cd. He some tight funky tunes on here. ""We are here to geek you Up and Sling Shot"" are too funky dance floor tracks."
negative,Read the book instead,"I was very disapointed with this movie. They took a 4-6 hour miniseries and chopped it into a 2 hour movie. They cut the whole daughter story line out, which took out half of the plot and made what was left a pale and poorly made farce of the books story. With half of the plot gone it makes it very confusing and unenjoyable.I recorded this movie/miniseries off of the TV years ago and was glad to get a prerecorded version. Well I hope my recorded version lasts a long time.I hope they release it on DVD, but as the complete item and not this butcher job."
negative,bogart's mxpx,"I also saw these guys LIVE with mxpx, but wasn't all that impressed. Their bass player had good stage presence. However, there songs were kinda boring. There was a cool band that opened up the show called Too Bad Eugene and they were cool as a lang hole. mxpx took the show."
positive,Good book,This book helped my 5 year old granddaughter right after her parents split. It was good for her to see that other kids live in the same situation. She was able to identify with the two homes that her world became.
negative,Died after 1 month,"Well, I lost all my data within a month. The drive just died one fine day. I cracked it open and discovered the circuit board was burnt. I thought I could atleast get my data back by putting the drive in an external enclosure. No luck there as the drive itself seems dead. Well thats the last time I buy a Seagate. There are a ton of bad reviews about this thing on the net, so be careful. Buy it only of you don't care about the data you put on it."
negative,Cash-less and Troubled,"Cash-less and troubled - that's me after trawling though close to 400 pages of twaddle. Really just a cut-and-paste of various facts and theories, lumped amongst some very poor fiction. The characters are all one-dimensional stereotypes, and the central character (""Joe"") just seems to want to kill anyone in order to get his own way - is this Christian; or how about trust in Jesus? I would think that Christian fiction, whatever that may be, should at least lead the reader to a sense of deeper faith or wanting to know more. This book does neither. Beware ... deception at work. This book is will only leave you with the empty feeling of having wasted your hard-earned money and more importantly, time. It troubles me that some very smart people have put their name to this. In Christ."
positive,Some New Twists on an Old Story,"In this version the Connecticut Yankee is an engineer who just graduated from college. He loves to experiment with mechanical devices and when one experiment goes badly, is knocked unconscious. He awakes to find himself in the Court of King Arthur and proceeds to get himself into all sorts of predicaments when he tries to bring T.V., radio, air travel, and football into their world. Production notes are included. I recommend this play for middle school students as an entertaining way to enrich the study of the literature of Mark Twain."
negative,Some Magical Moments in MGM Mishmash,"For those who grew up watching Gene Kelly's ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""On the Town,"" the MGM mishmash of ""Anchors Aweigh"" (1945) will prove a disappointment. Nevertheless, there are some magical moments. The film's highlight is Gene's breakthrough dance with Jerry the Mouse - a stunning fusion of animation and live-action. Along the way, Frank Sinatra sings a few memorable numbers amid the Technicolor splendor. However, you must keep your finger on the fast-forward button to encounter these gems. Running 140 minutes, it's obvious that the editor fell asleep at the Moviola. Though directed by the usually reliable George Sidney, one wishes Kelly had more creative control over this unwieldy project."
negative,Be very careful,If you don't have furniture that will fit very well into the sunken circular hole then you're better off just putting the $20 under it. I have a daybed with tapered square legs and these raised it up but it wasn't very sturdy. When I moved it a bit one of the tabs on the side popped off. From the picture you would think that this is all one piece of wood but really those raises corners are glued on and aren't going to hold anything. I ended up going at them with my drummel tool and widening and squaring the openings so that the legs would at least sink into them. Even after all that I'm glad that it's up against a wall. While the plastic ones look a little cheap at least the fact that they flare out at the bottom give them much better stability. If your furniture fits in the plastic ones go with them.
positive,I own three and love them all,"I own three, yes three, of these gates, to reign in my gloriously active, insane 15 month old. He rattles them, teethes on them, and slams them closed (when I forget and leave them open) -- and not one move out place, scratch, or dent on my wall. They are all in high traffic areas, too. They open and close shut very easily and install in minutes. I was very lucky -- my first attempt at buying a gate and I found a great one on the first shot. Highly, highly recommended."
negative,didn't like too hard to hold baby in it,i am a new mom so maybe that is the reason I don't like the tub. it is too high of an angle to wash a newborn. it is too hard to hold the baby with one hand and wash with the other. maybe when she gets older and has head control it will be better
negative,"Seems good, but subtle errors","FIrst thought the book would be good and seemed to give a decent overview. Was first cautious however when there was no official ""nothing against faith or morals"" Nihil Obstat mark that usually accompanies Catholic texts. WHile there were many good insights made about the Church, there were also some unfortunate comments about contraception and women's ordination that simply lies outside the mentality of the Catholic Church's official teachings. Making such statements tends to weaken the case for the intent of the book as being a guide. With the popularity of the ""idiots guide"" series, this book unfortunately makes the title more fulfilling than its attempt to do otherwise."
negative,Broken in 3 month,I bought this headphone 3 month ago and it is already broken. I cannot hear anything from right side. Too long cord is also bothering. It was first headphone for me and I am so disappointed at senheiser.
negative,NOT USER FRIENLY!,"The only good feature is the display great for a nite lite and seeing CID in the dark. The on/off for the ringer is located in the back. What a pain, have to pick up and turn around to operate ringer switch. Husband is shift worker so the phone gets turned on and off frequently. Elderly mother, so needs to be on when both parties sleeping. To set the alarms takes two hands, one on each side of the unit, and every time you hit an alarm button or setting buttons, it beeps. Not good for setting alarm in dark while spouse is sleeping. If the wrong button is hit while setting alarm, then have to go thru the whole setting process, Date, time, contrast. Much too difficult to operate, in low lite. Reasonable price but not worth it for the difficulty in setting alarms and ringer. Very low quality, in features. Not at all user frienly. Am returning the phone and will spend 3 times as much to get user friendly features, that are considerate of the sleeping spouse."
positive,A must for any sea kayaker,"Whether you're a begining paddler or someone who's been paddling for a few years, you'll be able to get something out of this tape. It features a number of well-known West Coast sea kayak instructors demonstrating paddling strokes, braces, rolls, and other techniques, all shown in a way that clearly illustrates what a properly done stroke or roll should look like. It also has good advice on trip planning, dealing with current and tides, and many other details.I bought this tape based on a review in Sewa Kayaker magazing that couldn't praise it highly enough. I wasn't disappointed. After four years of paddling, this tape showed me what I needed to know to move my bracing and recovery strokes up to the next level."
positive,A good read,This was a page tuner for me. Dahlia was very brave while also being very stubborn. Nico had that quiet determination. cannot wait to read the next book.
positive,Well done and needed,"True to its name, it speaks to our situation(s) here in America and it lines up to what the scriptures say."
positive,Excellent utility,"I bought the pine version of this item. It's very nice looking. The three, separately removeable, bags make it ideal for carrying laundry to the washer. It is a much better solution to sorting laundry than separate plastic bins or a sorter where the bins are not separate or removeable. The frame is pretty sturdy but could have been braced a little better. Mine has held up fine for two months. I like it."
negative,useless video,"this instructional video is of no use , you can learn more just by pushing buttons on unit. shows features and does not show how to use them at all. you can scroll down your menu and do the same thing!"
positive,I kid you not-This is good!,"Humphrey Bogart ia in one of his classic roles and those Fred MacMurray fans used to him as a doting father(My Three Sons) or a slightly addled good guy (Disney movies, notably The Absent Minded Professor) are in for a surprise as he hangs his colleagues out to dry. The typhoon sequence makes the film as well as a compelling case for Queeg's insanity. While Bogey's performance isn't up to Casablanca standards(and mothing is) he is certainly compelling. It's an enjoyable watch and can still pack a wallop."
negative,Repeat of crappy music.,"As far as I'm concerned, these guys are just like Good Charlotte. Completely untalented. I've heard this before. Their songs get old fast. Perfect annoys me. It's just a bunch of whining. I'm Just A Kid is more of the same. God, no more of this."
negative,American Con Artists,What a disappointment. The History Channel has really stooped low in airing this latest reality series. We have two 40 something guys (are they lovers) going around and ripping off granny and gran pops precious heirlooms and antiques.-It's called ripping people off when you offer pennies on the dollar for what something is actually worth.-A better show would be one where the old folks get revenge on these two turd bombers.
positive,Thor DVD,"It is what it is. Basic DVD, no frills or special packaging obviously. In good condition, crisp plastic wrappings so it should play well and play well."
positive,this does NOT sound like the Gaither Vocal Band,"For some time now, Russ has been part of Bill Gaither's gospel quartet, singing for blue-heads who can appreciatively close their eyes and nod dreamily to tranquil renditions of old-timey standards. But on ""The Way Home"", the man is unrestrained--and the result is one of the most powerful vocal performances on record, bar none. An outstanding collection of rock/gospel songs, crowned by the gorgeous, accordion-and-reverb-guitar ballad, ""I Cry."""
positive,"If you're looking for a good book to read, this is the one.","I think that this novel is terrific. This book is about a boy and the adventures he has with his two dogs. The bond between Billy and his dogs was unbreakable. In the end, it was his dogs who saved his life. Wilson Rawls is an excellent writer. The beginning of the novel was okay, but the ending was beautiful. The ending was really sad, and I even cried a bit. This novel is simply something too beautiful to be put into words;you'll have to read it for yourself to understand what I mean. All I can say is that this book is one that you definitely don't want to miss."
positive,Heat for Sleep,This is a great price. I bought them for someone who had a bone marrow transplant and was having terrible leg pains from meds. They gave her hours of heat and relief during the night.
positive,My MSU Fan loves this!,"I'm a skeptic with every online purchase, but I was pleasantly surprised. My future MSU student truly loves his new watch."
positive,good but not perfect,"I find the following shorts:1. I can still found the difference in the touch between it and a acoustic piano.2. When someone is using a cell phone nearby, it starts to beep: be be beeeee be beeee be....However, more money is needed to overcome such problems. Basically, it worth the money."
positive,Wonderful reference book for cottage gardeners,"I have owned this book for several years, and recently got a copy for a friend who is also into cottage gardening, and loves all things British. This book is chock full of ideas to help one create a beautiful garden. It is not a ""How to"" book, but a reference to help stimulate your own imagination. The photography is lovely, and the text is overflowing with information. I would (and did) buy this book again and recommend to anyone who loves English or cottage gardening."
negative,"For a supposed heartthrob, he got some big ol' lips.","Where would Abercrombie and Fitch, the Gap, J. Crew, and other stores that sell overpriced preppy clothes made by impoverished third-world children be without John Mayer? His music provides a perfectly bland accompaniment to the tough decisions that plague our nation's youth, like whether to get a rollneck sweater in pumpkin, cranberry, or periwinkle."
positive,Fantastic!,"It's a great album! Rap, hip-hop, soulful R&B all wrapped into one. She definitely has a soulful and powerful voice. A MUST to buy album!"
negative,Too verbose and not a good reference.,"The book wastes too many pages on how toconvey information, e.g., use headers thatlead the reader, use concise language,organize paragraphs in logical sequence.Excuse me, but I thought I am suppose tolearn about HTML, not high school English.Also, the book doesn't describe key HTML areasvery well: tables, colors of background and selectabletext, inserting your own background image.The structure of the book is not obvious soit is hard to use if you need to quickly lookup the syntax for an HTML tag. I have purchasedanother book to act as a reference. As matterof fact, I found many other books in the marketthat are much better at explaning HTML."
negative,Could not get into it,I don't know why but I just couldn't get into the story. After about 40% into the book I finally just gave up and closed it down. I still have it in my Kindle but believe me I will read everything else I have first and the. Might even pay for more books before I try to read it again.
positive,great continuos fun you get your monies worth,This is a great product. Very easy to collaspe and put away and my daughter loves it. Still asks for it about twice a week. She is almost two years old. Only complaint it does not attach well to the pop up house I have but good enough. Definately reccommend.
positive,Painful Choices...,"When mel learns that she actually WILL have to move back to the cuty, she's upset. yea, she can ride at the riding school, but...she left and didn't come back since the death of the horse she was riding out in the streets. All blamed her for it.However, Melanie soon learns that she gets to take her fave lil spunky pony, trib, with her. However, in the city...trib grows gloomy and depressed. He doesn't belong in the hustle and bustle! he belongs in the white fences and sprouting green grass and throughbreds at Whitebrook. The vet soon dtermines that trib is under dperession.melanie is upset. She won't go top see trib till break! Fianlly, her father signs over the guardianship to The reeses. Melanie can now call Whitebrook home-for good."
negative,"Worthless, don't waste your money","All of the other books I purchased on buying a home in France were far superior to this one, which provided only anecdotal information that was not helpful at all."
negative,Fast shipping but incomplete,"I recieved my item on time and earlier than expected. However the book was incomplete, missing half of the pages."
negative,Go back before it's too late ...,"I'm concerned my son has suffered brain damage as a result of watching this ""movie"" ... it is an insult to our children's intelligence. He thought it looked promising and begged, so there we were. Halfway through, he turned to me and said, ""Hey, at least we can make fun of it and be sarcastic like those robots, right?"" It is jerky, random, and poor in quality, makes blatant use of beaten-to-death stereotypes and at most points makes you want to think about your grocery list. Please don't make the mistake of buying/renting/telling others."
negative,Another Blues Sell Out,"Tone Cool has taken another great, honest blues artist and made them overly commercial by infusing rock and roll. ""Times They Are A Changing"" was a great blues CD, very close to the live performance I saw in September. Sure, BA has some rock tendencies, like his Dad did, but he had stayed true to the blues idiom up until this label switch. I give this CD 2 stars because I just can't get into it. If you are an EC or JH fan, then you would probably enjoy, but if you are a blues purist, better look elsewhere."
negative,Beware of quality issues,"We ordered this toy from Drugstore.com, which showed a picture of an older model, not the new ""upgraded"" toy. The idea of this toy is intriguing but the actual execution of the idea is less than stellar. The ""music"" is tinny and unattractive. Apparently, the older model had better sound quality, which is why I went with this vendor. However, communicating with Drugstore.com and the whole return process is a significant hassle. The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer. I would actually recommend either getting a used model with all purple corners (the older model) or buying it at a brick and mortar location so you can actually listen to it. If you are going to purchase on Amazon, consider another vendor. Very disappointed. I will not do business with this vendor again."
positive,"Ooh, Chris O'Donnell, Ooh, Minnie Driver","I have loved this movie since I first saw it over 10 years ago. I'm so glad I found a copy here, because it's still, such a wonderful film. Minnie Driver is incredible, a lovely trainwreck, and Chris O'Donnell is so lovely."
negative,Disappointing,I am great fan of Sherlock Holmes and of Christopher Lee. I regret buying this DVD - th B&W; movie looks all washed out - the dubbing is comically bad and the voices - to rob Christopher Lee of his voice - borders on the criminal.I could not even finish watching it - its that bad!Don't buy this - even if you are a fan of the Great Detective.
positive,5-star-movie: Joy Ride,"This movie has it all.... fear, anticipation, and even some black humor in the right spots! When they say its a ""White knuckle thriller"", they are right on! I was on the edge of my seat squeezing my husband's hand the whole time !!"
positive,Timeless.,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It was interesting, well-written, and true to life. It portrays the 1950s in a way that's often ignored - the darkside. Fascinating. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in a philosophical look at human beings."
negative,Don't Read the Book.....,Everything you need to know is already out there. Eat every three hours. Keep your blood sugar stable. Pick healthier choices if you can. Exercise a little. I got all the info from the media and I had lost 10 pounds before even buying the book. I read the book and got nothing new from it. Don't bother. Just do the diet. Its great!
positive,Bacteria Treatment,Wouldn't use a humidifier without this treatment! Need it to prevent mold and mildew. Will probably order again next winter.
positive,Charlie's Adventure!,I Love this book!Roald Daul is genuis.And it is better than the movie!Look for the movie remake this year(in 2005) in July!
negative,amazing and unbelievable,This production is so bad that no words could do justice in describing it. You would have to be godlike and have a masochistic streak a mile long to get through the entire production.
positive,One of the best cocktail party topic books ever,"""Freakonomics"" is a gold mine of interesting facts and trivia, including how much money a crack dealer makes, the life cycle of popular baby names, how sumo wrestlers work the system and how the Chicago school system caught teachers cheating on standardized tests.It's not a lot more than that -- the book is openly just an extended magazine article, and not a particularly critical one at that -- but it's a quick and interesting read; I knocked out most of it in a single transcontinental plane flight. And, honestly, when's the last time there was a quick and interesting read about economics?The book could use both more length and depth, but hopefully that will come in the form of a sequel.Recommended for those looking for a fun and interesting quickie read. Not so recommended for those hoping this is a profound work that will somehow change their life."
negative,"condition of book fine, substance light","It took longer than I expected to receive this product, although within time estimates given. Condition of book was fine for a used book, although the substance was mush. I wouldn't recommend reading it."
positive,Nice light read,Although farfetched in some places the story was a lighthearted tale of a daughter's search to understand her dead mother. I find myself wanting to read the next book about what happens next.
positive,Crime/Mystery with a Philosophical Twist,"Directed interestingly, acted well, written heavy-handedly. Aside from the use of color, the directing has nothing on any other high budget action movie. Of course, these are well directed for their purpose. Morgan Freeman acts very well, Paltrow acts as she always does, and Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt. He wasn't always convincing, but this I'll blame on the writer giving him an impossible, unconvincing character. The writer was preaching, and he preached an interesting movie. But if you want to see the same message preached more intelligently, watch David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet."" To give ""Seven"" its due, it preaches less blatantly than BV, but also less brilliantly. In the end, it is slightly more intelligent than the average big budget movie, but it is not perfect. It's worth watching, maybe twice, but not buying."
negative,"A bore, simple as that","British Sea Power are being lauded as an eccentric English band with songs about the North Pole ( Oh Larsen B ) and playing concerts at the Chelsea Flower Show but they are so crushingly boring it's unreal. Admittedly the album starts off nicely but within 2 or 3 songs you notice that it becomes more of the same stuff again and again. The production on this is horrible as it just gives off a horrible lumpiness to the proceedings. If it were handled with a little more care, perhaps it might have sounded less forced. To their credit though the band have admitted this and that's fine by me.Incidentally, they've been playing a freeform gig with legendary Krautrock gods Faust. Apparently the drummer was doing one of these long drum solos which pissed off the lead singer of Faust so much that the singer went over and started punching him in the face and led to a bit of a brawl. The drummer ended up with a black eye. Ouch"
negative,I Had a Good Time...returning this CD,"Tom Sholtz and his Cosmic Cosmo Crew have created what is arguably the cheesiest bunch of ""songs"" on this planet. Chester Cheetah must love this one. Wanna do it again? NO!"
positive,A Black Metal Masterpiece!,What more can really be said this is Dimmu Borgir. In extreme theatrical black metal style they deliver another masterpiece that will keep them on top in their genre. They take some getting used to which I'm still working on but you can't knock these guys for the talents and abilities they demonstrate in this album. It is finely produced at every point and like other cds by this band you get a eerrie evil feeling listening to them which means they are good at what they do. If you like black metal then dont fail to pick this new one by Dimmu Borgir you won't be disappointed by any means.
positive,Great reference book,"As an anatomy reference for artists, this book is fabulous. I have not yet seen its equal. It has detailed drawings of all the bones and muscles of the body from multiple angles, and goes through the layers of muscles as well (again, from multiple angles), showing where the muscles connect to the bones. It also has useful text descriptions for increased clarity where pictures might not be enough (such as explaining the function of a muscle).It isn't a good book to learn anatomy from, but I recommend it whole-heartedly as a detailed anatomy <em>reference</em> for artists who already have a decent understanding of human anatomy."
positive,A superb R & B album - every song is excellent,"Winwood's Roll With It is one of his very best works. The songs all have infectious R & B rhythms which show Stevie's sense of soul. The title track, ""Holdin On"" and ""Don't You Know What the Night Can Do"" are the album's highlights. The arrangements do not show the subtle complexity of sounds present in more recent works, but the songs are pure magic."
negative,Buyer beware,The book did not look new. Looked as if it was sitting on the shelf for years. I was not happy with the appearance of the book.
positive,StoneWords is a book about a little girl and her ancester.,"StoneWords is about a little girl named Zoe ,and her ancestor named Zoe Louise.Everyday the girls would get together and play with their dolls.Until one day on Zoe Louise's birthday, there's a tragic fire that takes Zoe Louise's life. Zoe's garden has rose bushes in the loving memory of Zoe Louise,planted by her dear mother.Zoe feels guilty about Zoe L.'s death,because Zoe had already once saved Zoe Louise from being killed! This book is an excellent book, who knows, maybe one day you'll get to meet your ancestors!!!!!!"
negative,Logitech headsets,Sound is great. quality is great. The only problem is that it cannot be used for long at a stretch because ears start aching after sometime. The bar of the headset could have been adjustable.
positive,Ok gun... good for price,"I bought it right after seeing that it was a semi and full automatic pistol for such a low price. It has been working good for me, rarely jams, but sometimes it your too careless with it, the batteries fall out of the bottom on to the ground. As for performance it hurts at close range and is accurate at about 20 feet. If you need a cheap pistol like I did, I would get it, but if you have some extra money, find something better."
negative,Glimpses of other's psychosis,An extremely practical friend recommended this book and said a very reputed woman had written it etc. This is just the same old extremely bizarre totally unlikely science fiction. I have never believed anything about alien abductions and still don't. Two men in England started the crop circles and have been doing them for years. This book was very disappointing and I am embarassed that I paid money for it.
positive,Metaphysical Classic,Back in the 70s my mom asked me to check this out from the library for her. Back then I really didn't care much about this type of subject matter but have recently begun to search for the truth about our reality here on earth and in this universe. This book is one of the first of its kind and is a classic in the genre. It contains some good insights and is a good part of any personal Metaphysical/Spiritual curriculum.
positive,"For what it is, it's great","Let's say you need to drill some holes in concrete, maybe necessitating having access to a hammer drill for several days on different occasions and you don't want to hassle or pay the price to rent one. This is a great item. It ain't heavy industrial vintage, but it gets the job done for what it would cost to rent one."
positive,great water bottle,"based on the previous reviews, I purchased this bottle. I've been using it for a week and can report that this bottle is worth its cost. It does NOT sweat, it fits into my purse, and it keeps ice cubes solid over night. Do not hesitate to purchase this product. I'm thinking about buying one for hot liquids also."
positive,Great DVD Player,"I got this for my husband recently for a Father's Day gift and he was so very suprised that he now owns one. He, at one time thought that maybe next year we can get it, but my cousin convinced me that it's worth it. So far, so good. I have a membership to Netflix and we rent 3 DVDs at a time and all three sound so fabulous. The most impressive one was Pulp Fiction. It really sounds like you are in a cinema. This is a must buy."
negative,Not-so-Shocked,"K.A. Applegate is slowly displeasing most of her younger fans. Twisted plot lines, uneven endings, and shorter books just keep coming. Terrible. I expected so much as this series got farther and farther. Each time I have been disapointed. Though I find myself slowly growing out of these books, I still enjoy reading about my favorite characters, Rachel, Cassie, Marco, Jake, Tobias, and Ax. Please think about what you are looking for when you buy this book."
positive,Great series,Fantastic set of the Inspector Lewis series from the beginning episode - fills in some gaps that I have missed watching the PBS intermittent showings.
positive,"Not what I expected, but it grew on me","I'll admit to being disappointed when this book first arrived (a couple of years ago now). I must not have paid very close attention to the details and was expecting something different. However, I came to enjoy reading about how Halloween was celebrated in its Golden Age.The one complaint I have about this book has been stated by other reviewers as well: the illustrations are too small! Many of the images would be SO much better if they were larger. (The desktop publisher in me also *cringes* at the page layout!) More pages with larger graphics would have resulted in a better book (and five stars from me)."
negative,Make that a zero.........It doesn't warrant a star,"...Should be called ""For Women: How to kiss up to men, pretend their mistakes are okay, their forgotten duties are okay, never correct him, and allow them to take no responsibility in the workplace, even the men that can't remember your name""Perhaps as long as he notices you when you are looking particularly good and gives you a non-sexual compliment it's okay, eh? (from the book)This book takes the idea of equality back about 200 years, but in a smarter more devious way..."
negative,oh boy is this mislabelled,"I played this during a massage, as generally music that is advertised as relaxing or romantic makes good massage music. This one started out all right, it advertises itself as ""exquisite melodies for that perfect evening."" But there is a 13 minute organ selection that sounds like a funeral. And then there is the March of the Toreadors. I was trying not to laugh until I realized my client was snickering - we both laughed pertty hard. Just so NOT relaxing or a good match for ""that perfect evening."""
positive,Another Lori Foster winner..,"There are some authors that you know always write engaging novels that you cannot go wrong with- Lori Foster is one of them. The Men of Courage series introduced Riley and Regina and finally Riley has his own story.Riley is an ex Swat team member who runs a gym as well as works as an evidence technician. He meets Regina, a journalist, when she comes into his gym looking for some self defence training. The police do not believe her, but Regina fears that her life is in danger. She gets a ""guard"" dog and much of the book's comedy revolves around her 4lb pet chihuahua ""Butch"".This story is humerous and well written, Riley and Red are a good match. The added mystery of who is putting her in danger is a nice bonus, plus the antics of the cute little dog will keep you turning the page. Another winner!!Be sure to read the Men of Courage anthology first- Ethan's story will introduce you to Riley and Red."
negative,"won't work on 1 1/4"" drain","the manufacturer claims that this drain key will work on both 1 1/2 and 1 1/4 inch drains. however, the tool has a stepdown (the smaller part at the end of the aluminum spreading part) that is supposed to be used for 1 1/4 inch, but it does not have anything to grip the inside of the drain like the part for 1 1/2 inch does. basically, it will just spin inside the drain. you can't get it tight enough to work. there are better options for removing a drain than this. if you are patient and have some confidence, just use a chisel and hammer."
negative,Don't Waste Your Money,"Unless you are a teenager trying to shave off a little peach fuzz, the 3612 won't do the job.The motor is so weak it almost stalls out on anything heavier than even a moderate overnight growth.The small foil will most likely wear quickly due to it's small surface area and is a joke compared to my old Braun 2000. Using the 3612 makes me long for my old 2000 back, too bad they don't make those anymore.Braun has discontinued the 3612 and I don't think I will shed any tears over that."
negative,You sent the wrong product,You mailed to me Xenit Mold Cleaner. So I still don't have the Xenit Citrus Cleaner and Remover - 10 oz. product.I can't rate it.............I never got it..............but if I have to rate so you can get this message I will.
positive,No Problems So Far!,"I bought this for a plane trip in February. I still use Cds but it was too much to carry, so I figured I could download them to this. I've never had a problem with this until I LOST THE USB Cable. It downloaded music without a problem. I've been looking to find one cheap just for the Cable, but nothing so far...If someone is willing to sell me their USB Cable cheap, please let me know."
negative,No improvement at all,"I bought the product based on many positive user reviews, but now I wonder if they were all comments from people affiliated with the seller?! I have used the product diligently since early November, but my nails are the same as they were before. I'll give it a few more weeks. If no improvement still, I plan to look up their return policy and return the product."
positive,A very good reference work,Short biographical sketches of prominent living Jews are the heart of this volume. Unfortunately if the last issue is 1990 it is dated and of limited value. The edition I have of this work was at one time very valuable to me. It helped me learn about a large number of people whose names I knew but who I knew little about.
positive,A Must Have!!!,"This live version album is a must have for all Sonia Dada fans. They sound amazingly wonderful in concert as they do on their albums. Unfortunately, it appears they won't be back together anytime soon. :( Sonia Dada deserves more commercial success than they received and are truly a group of gifted and talented musicians."
negative,Too small; No compartments,"I was very disappointed in this case. The 12 amp 4-1/2"" grinder won't even fit with the cord attached. Nothing to keep the tool from flopping around inside. I saw the case that was included with the 4-1/2"" 8 amp grinder, and it showed a bracket for the tool and a quick reference guide for disc selection.Come-on Milwaukee; you built the tool well, surely you can put together a case that's matched to the tool. Especially for $34.50.VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"
positive,Enter the Age of Elizabeth,"It didn't surprise me when I learned that both Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons had won Golden Globe awards for their performances in this mini-series. It's absolutely superb and takes you more deeply into the Elizabethan Age than any other work I know of. Most of all, it helps us to understand the conflicts this remarkable woman faced during her tumultuous reign. The film is much more about her handling of politics and religion than it is about her relation to the arts (see the much more superficial ""Shakespeare in Love"" for that, but it evokes the feel of her court and especially her relationships with the Earl of Leister and the Earl of Essex. A completely engaging film."
positive,Are you ready to change your life?,"I have read three books from this author. About a year ago, I came across with a book ""The Power of Your Subconscious Mind"". Everafter I have been interested in Joseph Murphy's books. Joseph Murphy explains you some of the most amazing laws of cosmic mind power that will help you on your path to success. He has written carefully 15 chapters on some of the most profound areas of the life.It has been my dream to move to the States, and become a police officer there. I believe that Joseph Murphy's books will help me to achieve my goals, and help others to help themselves.I promise that this book will reveal a whole ""new you"" to you. However, I gave it only 4 stars as something is missing from this book. It is simple, and a reader who is looking for very advanced hints won't find many of them. This book is a good and basic resource for creating success.. but I would still recommend you to read to read The Powermind System and Power Pause.I wish you the best success!"
negative,this sucked,I think maybe you have to be from the 80s in order to appreciate this movie. I am not from the 80s..... so i thought it sucked ;(
positive,Two Thumbs Up,"Dances With Wolves is a excellent movie for anyone to view, whether it be for entertainment or film study. It's quirky humor would appeal to those watching for recreation, and the interesting twist of storyline from cowboys vs. indians to indians vs. cowboys is a topic for conversation and study alike. This movie is a showcase for Kevin Costner, and the gorgeous landscapes wideshots makes it a beautiful watch.I would recommend this movie to all."
positive,Best freakin bookshelf speakers for the money,"For my 7.1 surround sound these were large enough for sound bass and yet small enough to hang from speaker brackets I bought at Walmart. I had listened to the smaller versions of these but were 2-ways with little bass. These 3-ways are the way to go along with a center speaker for voice and a sub-woofer for bass. Best Buy could get these at $110 a pair but when I ordered them, they never called me while the same day I ordered these from Amazon and they showed up a day earlier than Best Buys would have...plus Amazon shipping was free and no tax. WTF more could you ask for. Don't hesitate...go ahead and order them. Very versatile speakers."
positive,That‚Äôs 70‚Äôs Show Season Six,My husband is a constant fan and gets at least a dozen laughs every time he watches this show. He has all 6 seasons so far.
negative,Disappointed!,"I purchased this item thinking it would do what it said it would. When it arrived I was totally shocked! It came in a small bag, it was very thin and did not do the job it stated it would do. I wanted to return it back to the company, but to my surprise, it was up to me to pay again for shipping! Thirty Dollars thrown out the window. I would have been better off going to a Hardware store and purchasing plywood for better support."
negative,Extremely heavy and bulky!!,"I bought this bike for my 5 year-old because I thought it would be a good bike--wrong! The bike is EXTREMELY heavy, bulky and not a good fit for a kid. It is even hard for me to carry up and down from my SUV. The first time we tried to take my son for a ride he was crying the entire time and complaining that he was unable to lift the bike from the top of him, how sad is that?? I would not recommend this bike to anyone! I then decided to spend extra money and bought him a Specialized bike, in aluminum, so much better!! It is not for sale on Craigslist."
negative,spins too fast,"it may talk really well, but the arrow spins too fast as if the toy was broken. on the pull string ones, the arrow was spinning at perfect speed, if the arrow spinned that fast, it was broken, I may be old fashion in the toy department, but something really tells me that the battery isn't in there"
positive,where it all began,"while this isn't my favorite Firewind CD it's a nice listen, not as deep as later CDs by any means, and there's nothing seperating this one from any other power metal bands, but it's an enjoyable listen. as it's a rerelease you get some of the demo songs they submited, and this really give you the feel of a band starting out."
positive,Delightful fun for kids and dog lovers!,"This is a sweet book about two family pets--Springer spaniels--and how they communicate when Annie, the older dog, loses her leg to cancer. The mischievious younger dog Max brings a smile to all with his antics and attitude. This is an excellent tool for getting kids to use their imagination, talk about writing, mental and visual images. This book sets the stage for the author's later books with more adventures for Max and Annie."
negative,POOR PRODUCTION,"No matter how good the tracks(and there's only two good ones on this release), you are simply not going to enjoy it with this poor production. Sounds like it's playing in the next room with the door closed! I'm astonished that Nicko would permit his drumming to sound so flat. The guitars are pushed to the background. Bruce's mid B pitch is grating on the ear. Compare to how good he and the band sound on Brave New World and Dance Of Death. I bought this on CD, so it must be unbearable as a download(in case you don't know, downloaded music loses a significant amount of resolution)."
negative,NOT AS PICTURED!! BEWARE!!!,"The pictured flat iron, with comb attachment, is the greatest flat iron EVER. However, THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE!! They are subbing a worthless flat iron without a comb attachment... same as you could pick up at any CVS or Target for $17. It is useless... absolutely will not work. Hoping they will not make me pay return shipping for what is clearly, even in basic appearance, unrelated to what I purchased."
positive,Je l'adore!!!,"We watched this video in French class and it is hilarious.My favorites are Elijah Woods as a vampire and the subway one.I don't know how accurately this represents France, not even sure if it is supposed to... but I love it."
negative,Worthless Piece of GARBAGE,"Initial reviews were great for this product, so I thought I made a good decision. My burner worked great for a few months ( I burned 5 or 6 CD's). Suddenly it is identified by Windows (98, ME, and 2000 Pro) but will not read ANY CD that is inserted. NO support from Yamaha. I might as well have paid $150.00 for a steaming pile of crap and shoved it in my computer. I paid about $25 a piece for each CD burned. I will never buy a Yamaha product ever again."
positive,Tons of good music here. . .,"I got this record simply because of the amount of songs on it, and I figured that there had to be at least a few good songs here out of the 40. And there are some good songs, a few bad ones, and two or three amazing tracks. The best out of all the songs is ES EE EX by Sean Paul, which is just vintage Sean Paul, and him at his top form. On the second cd there is Bun It by Elephant Man & Mr. Vegas which is great. Also on the second cd is See Dem a Come by Mr. Lex, Bust It by Sean Paul, and two very good records by Beenie Man Cool Bwoy and Moses Cry. Back on the first Black Power by Bounty Killer is very respectible as is Cuyah Cuyah by the Prophet, Attack by Kalonji, and I'm a Big Kid Now, from Red Rat. Overall, its very good, listen to it several times and it will grow on you, good compilation by Greensleeves."
positive,Great book for classroom management,"I love the ENVoY strategies. This book is easy to read and implement right away. The strategies focus on the non-verbal cues you as a teacher can give in the classroom to helps students stay focused and on task. I especially like how effecient these strategies are, and how many can be used without interrupting instruction.This is a great addition to anyone's classroom management style."
positive,A+ for INNOVA 3030,"Bought a Chinese made one U380 and test a U480, both did not work with my 2004 Silverado. They both worked with my 03 Xterra, though. Thought that something was wrong with my truck OBD connector until I tested it with the INNOVA 3030. It read the code in less than a minute. I give it a ***** for code reading."
negative,Pastor Troy-Step Up Your Rap Game,"dont get me wrong i like pastor troy but on this album he should have came better than he did.listenin to this album i get the feel of all his releases.all his albums sound the same,its like he is not progressing.that is probably the reason why this album didnt get much advertisement.this is a waste of 10 bucks,keep your money."
negative,The Essential Alfred Hitchcock Collection,"The movies on this DVD are all silent!! I bought these as a gift for someone who had never seen a Hitchcock film. I never thought that they would all be ""Silent"" and in Black and white!"
positive,A Nice Recording,"London Town is the seventh Wings album, and sixth to contain at least one Top 40 single. In, fact it features three, the usual catchy ballad ""With A Little Luck,"" the rocker ""I've Had Enough,"" and the pleasent ditty ""London Town."" It is a very pleasent album altogether, and is more acoustic than any other Wings album. Highlights include the Donovan-ish ""Children, Children,"" the Buddy Holly-ish ""Name and Adress,"" and probably the most progressive Wings song, ""Morse Moose and the Grey Goose."" The album's highest point is probably the obscure but lovely ballad ""I'm Carrying."" The b-side to ""Mull of Kintyre"", ""Girl's School"" is a nice addition as a bonus track. You will most likely enjoy this disc if you like other albums by Paul like Flaming Pie."
negative,umbrella base,This base was too light weight for my 9'umbrella. Sent it back.purchased a 65 pound weight base that will hold a 9'umbrella.
negative,le misarable,Le Miserables this book was not as interesting as I thought and was heavy reading and was far too long
negative,Simply lousy...,"I hate to see the rating on this film misrepresented so I have to rate it. Aside from the lousy picture and sound, the movie stinks. Hard to believe both John Sturges and Charles Bronson were involved in this schlup, if that's even a word..."
negative,A Big Let-Down!,"Sadly, despite waiting years to get a copy of this wonderful Sammi Smith album on CD, I have to say it's not worth the plastic it's been put on. It's a recording from vinyl and not a good one at that. I do hope that we see a digitally remastered copy sometime in the future.Peter Nicholls - Adelaide - South Australia"
positive,Good product.,Bought this kit as a replacement set and have had no complaints about it yet. Reliable and easy to use.
negative,This novel is like...Ah never mind...It just sucks,Loving is one of the worst novels I have ever read. The dialogue--which other reviewers praised --is too fake and rehearsed to sound in the least natural. All of the characters--including the servants--speak in an overly stuffed scholarly tone that reeks of snobish English professors and equally arrogant students trying to impress them. For God's sake! Can't characters in a novel speak like normal human beings and don't have reviewers regard the novel as trash
negative,English class,"Good time travel books can be engrossing and plausible. Lost Child has many intriguing elements - Stonehenge, medieval history, a magical ring. Its foundations are great, but the rest - plot, characters, dialogue - fails to build upon them. The back of the book quotes White's English teacher, who called her ""Queen of the run-on sentence."" White seems to have conquered that little problem, but could use more time in English class. Lost Child reads like a high school short story. It's distracting to keep being told what we're supposed to be thinking (eg, ""only one person could do that - Adam."") Reading a good book is like watching a movie in your head. It's a pity, but it's just too hard to keep your mind on the action in Lost Child."
negative,anxiety wrap,I mistakenly ordered this product instead of the Thunder Shirt. This product is hard to put on the dog and is not worth the trouble. I have since ordered the Thunder Shirt and the difference is amazing! It's so easy to put on and the dog is much more comfortable wearing it. DO NOT ORDER THE ORIGINAL ANXIETY WRAP---YOU'LL REGRET IT.
positive,Surly man brings laughter,This story is once again a great tale with real life characters who struggle with the same embarrassing situations we do
positive,Fine Rohmer,"A Summer's Tale is a typical Eric Rohmer film, and for those unfamiliar with Rohmer, this is as good a place to stast as any. For those who are willing to lose themselves in Rohmer's style of film-making, A Summer's Tale has many rewards. For those who do not appreciate Rohmer's style, well, at least you gave it a try. To criticize a Rohmer film for being wordy and having no plotline is tantamount to criticizing a Hitchcock film for being suspenseful. Rohmer makes films in which you learn about characters through the conversations, not through the story line. They require patience and are certainly not for every taste. Much like films by the Japanese master Ozu, by the end, even though not much has ""happened,"" somehow we have a much better understanding of who these characters are."
negative,Why Use the Cover From the HORRIBLE Film?,"The book is worthy of the praise it has received and its position on the Best Seller lists. The film is a total travesty from screenplay to cast.Why trash the Kindle edition with a terrible cover? Even if no one sees the cover on their Kindle, viewing it online is a reminder of how badly Hollywood butchered the book."
positive,Outlaw Mountain,"I am both a Joanna Brady fan and a JP Beaumont fan. In the winter rain of Seattle, I especially enjoy letting my mind wander to the heat of Arizona and Sheriff Brady's attempts to keep the peace in Cochise County. JA Jance continues to develop both Joanna Brady and the people who are a part of her daily life. Outlaw Mountain is not just about another murder, but about community and personal issues any of us could face."
positive,Sambucus Lozenge,"I have used this product for about a year now and find that it really works. At the onset of a suspected sinus or upper respiratory problem, I take two a day. By day 2 or 3, all my negative symptoms are gone. This product is a ""life saver."" It allows me to continue my daily routine without side effects and later proves its worth by avoiding a doctor visit.I was referred to this product by an elderly woman who used the liquid form of the product. She was right, it works. I just wish it worked for everything. But as we all know, ""one size doesn't fit all."""
positive,almost as good as being at the concert,"I previously only knew of Mr. Matthews from what I heard on the radio and I'd never heard of Mr. Reynolds. My husband and I lucked into some cheap tickets for their show in Vegas and were blown away by the experience. Consummate musicians! So I ordered this CD and was very pleased with it. Excellent introduction to their music, or if you're like most of the audience who knew all the words to the songs, you'll love it too."
positive,Read this book like a novel!,"This book is full of information, it must be read like a novel. It contains information that is specifically for your area and is unmatched in its detail. The photographs are real and well done. Living in California presents it gardening perks and problems. All of them are covered here."
positive,Awesome Sci-Fi Film that makes you think!,This box office hit is one of the best movies ever made. It is a violent thinking man's Sci-Fi flick. Was it all an implant or real? To this day fans still debate over this. The extras are awesome esspecially the Schwarzenegger commentary.
positive,Good book!,"I really love this book, my boyfriend does too.It is helping us stay spiritually connected while we are far from eachother during college.I would certianly recommend this book to couples!"
positive,An eye opener...,Every woman needs to read this book before they get married. Trust me....unless you are a lesbian. I do believe it is possible to marry someone who is just not into you. But once you are married you can't just break it off....
negative,Keeps leaking,Have had the under counter filter for three years. Have changed leaking screw downs five times. Each time it cost me money for a new screw cap ... about $15 with shipping. Each time they say they have corrected the problem(the threads fail because it is a cheap plastic molded part)Stay away from this product unless you like playing with plumbing under the sink.
positive,Veg-o-rama,"A well written, detailed book wherein each chapter brings a new vegetable and great ideas. I was primarily looking to make vegetables play a more central and creative role in my cooking, and this book has been the answer. You'll be carmelizing onions and braising endive in no time."
positive,Classic book,"this book is pretty incredible book but a bit long! Jane Austen's characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, and the bad lady Miss Bingley Jane all add to this complicated plot. Elizabeth Bennett is very well shown character, maybe the best ever written This novel is an excellent example of Austen's literary power. Her ladies are to be admired for they marry for love not the social reasons. There is a lot of pressure in society to marry in your social class but love should be the main reason. Maybe the reason it seems a bit long is there are many characters, it is difficult to keep up with them all. Pride and Prejudice has to be read at least twice to catch everything and everybody. But it is an enjoyable read."
negative,Only So-So,"This book seems to require that the reader already has a good basic knowledge of Mexican and California History -- quite hard to follow and understand. Still, I got the gist and some information. Not recommended as a primer on the CA Missions."
positive,Classic,"This has always been one of my favorite movies. It's about the crazy hijinks of a car club set in the late 50's, early 60's. All throughout the movie are some great songs and great cruising cars from that time. Racing on the strip and visiting the local drive in burger joints were also a sign of that time. In this movie the burger joint is Tubby's and it's about to be closed down for so called ""progress"" and the opening of a new office building in it's place. Throughout the night of the closing the Hollywood Knights gain some new initiates and lose one of the older members to the Vietnam war draft. You won't be disappointed with this movie. You will be sure to laugh a lot. Be prepared to be taken back in time."
positive,ISLAMIC IMPERIALISM,"This is the most thorough account I have read of how we got to where we are in the Middle East. All along I thought, as the Palestinians, have been telling us, that this was about land. Well it's not, and this is not a new phenomenon. Its just another chapter, since Mohammed came out of his cave in the 7th century and declared himself a prophet. Iran...the same goal, conquest, pure and simple. Middle Eastern tribes have been fighting each other since the beginning and continue to do so. After reading this book I now seriously doubt if we will ever have peace in the Middle East. This is about conquest, domination in the region, and the destruction of Israel. Nothing more, nothing less. I still hope, but it's fading."
negative,Rosie the Riveter would be ashamed,"Women all over the world should be ashamed of the way we are depicted as silly, love-struck, unthinking beings who would sacrifice ourselves, our integrity, our honor for just an iota of a boy's attention. Such drivel only regresses young, impressionable women to shallower depths."
negative,Ugh,"Only 2 reasons to see it, if any: Baldwin & Cruise. The rest -- zip. Hangs together only cause it's all put in one movie."
positive,Easy piano,This is a great beginner book; it got great scores with easy to read accompaniment. Another book to get is the Disney Movies Hits.
negative,***HORRIBLE DVD PLAYER***,"I got this DVD player free with an APEX television (...). A friend of mine has an APEX DVD player but a different one and it has always worked perfectly fine, so I thought this was a good deal. Yeah, not so much. It worked fine for the first month and a half or so, but I noticed some rattling and very strange noises when it would play a DVD. Then, I noticed that it would freeze and skip frames on perfectly good cds. Next thing I know, it won't read any of my DVDs, no matter which ones I put in. I'm giving up on this piece of junk and getting a new one in a couple of days.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PLAYER! YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!"
negative,worst book I've ever read,"We read this for our book club and it was voted the book we would most like to burn. Which we are actually considering for the torture it put us though. (There was, in all honesty, one person who liked it.) If you want to be totally depressed I would highly recommend this book. The characters, especially the mother, were pitiful stupid creatures. If some of them had died in the end I would have felt a little better about it. I love to read and this is the first book that I have ever read where I literally hated reading every page. I can't wait for the bonfire!"
positive,Nerf N-Strike Night Finder EX-3 Review,"I bought this item about three hours ago and it is quiet an exceptional Nerf gun. The unit includes a ""lazer"" that can be used for aiming at you child's unsturdy carboard target or his big brothers face. Overall, this item is great and I enjoy it very much."
positive,Thank you Dr. Geisler,"This book is a clear cut easy to understand treatment of a difficult and controversial subject within the body of Christ. Dr. Geisler does not over analyze each scriptural reference but rather lets the verses speak for themselves, in context, without letting his comments or any manmade doctrines override the meaning. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would reccommend any person struggling with calvinistic issues should read it."
positive,Great space saver,We love this bottle storage device. It holds plenty of bottles and takes up little room on the counter. It's easy to take apart and clean. We don't use the brush (it's a bit flimsy).
positive,Everybody pick this record up!!!!,"I hadn't really listened to Meth before I bought this album, but I knew it would be tight. It just had this look about it. Then I popped it in the CD player and Johnny Blaze blew me away. I swear, his voice is like a drug. I AM ADDICTED TO METHOD MAN! With pounding beats produced by The RZA (pick up Bob Digital too!) and awesome lyrics, this album can put you in a trance. The best songs are ""Judgement Day"", ""Dangerous Grounds"", ""Big Dogs"", ""Break Ups 2 Make Ups"" and awww I'm not gonna list em all. Just go see for yourself."
positive,"Sterling Silver Vine Pendant, 16""","Better than I expected. The pendant is large, but not too big and really makes a great accessory when paired with tops or dresses that are not too busy. Excellent quality--they did not skimp on the silver. The silver choker is perfect length and very comfortable--good clasp. I've received lots of compliments--would make a great gift."
negative,Not terribly interesting,"I can't say this book is absolutely horrible, but it isn't good either. I read it on the advice of some guy who liked it, but I didn't. The breadth and wealth of topics discussed is staggering, but none of them are treated especially well, and some seemed hardly of any relevance. I still think the way they presented structures such trees and lists, with pairs, is a very braindead approach. C style pointers are much more intuitive and flexible. Aside from that, this text might be OK as a simple reference of what's out there, but there are definitely better books on just about any topic presented in this text. I only got through chapter 4 and got very bored along the way.Buy at your own risk. This book is way overrated and boring."
negative,Do NOT order this!,"I cannot express how LIVID I am over being duped into buying what I thought was the widescreen theatrical cut of THE LAST EMPEROR on Blu-Ray.From the criterion site: ""We do not windowbox Blu-ray (-) movies.""Incorrect. The aspect ratio has been changed. Sides trimmed off slightly. I don't care if it was with auteur approval. I don't care if Jesus approved of this trim job. If I wanted a cut, I'd bring the thing to a barber!For $30, there should have been two discs: the 'theatrical' release in widescreen, and whatever other versions y'all felt inclined to release.This reveals bald contempt for the customer and simple disregard for cinema.Do NOT order this.(A phenomenal movie with a history of being butchered in VHS/DVD releases.)"
negative,Author - Please Improve this book!!,"* Note: Would the author of this book please take note to the following!!I have started reading this book, but I am already finding it time consuming and non-efficient. As a designer, I have used countless manuals. Comparing this to a friends Lightwave 7 manual I have these things to say:* although the book has information to relate, it does so badly. Points are not set out in the text, and tutorials are not taken through in steps (rather, a mass of info). The tutorials and general text are waffly and badly written. The author should have written in a concise, informative, bullet-point style format. Also, it would help to have helpful hints at side of text - in margin.* Pictures are B/W and appaling* The book starts relatively well, but when it gets to tutorial in 3rd chapter, the author gets really lazy and does not explain in-between steps and wastes readers time!If you are to buy this book, be sure to have plenty of time on your hands and a highlighter!!"
positive,just a tad,"I bought this option just 'cause it was inexpensive relative to the kreg fence. But when I needed just another 15 thousandth after making the 1st cut (in metal), you were there. It's a must buy with the fence."
negative,Garbage,"What a piece of garbage. The top was chopped and clumpy and trying to brush it was a nightmare. Very disappointed. The shipping was fast, but cost too much."
positive,ancient egypt,this is a great book on ancient egypt. this book has 60 pages that are filled with lots of info. this book has a great overveiw on ancient egypt and is filled with lots of great colored pictures on every page. if you are into ancient egypt you will want to buy this book that is great for all ages.
negative,Excellent sound - poor durability,"I have owned two pair. First pair: one ear bud died after about 4 months of daily use, I mean, spontaneously died. Like, I was listening, and the sound in one ear just went away and never came back. This made me mad, but I really liked the sound, so I ordered another pair. Again, used every day while I work, lasted about 6 months, one side died. I continued to stay optimistic and said, ""That's okay, I need one ear free anyway so I can hear any calls from work."" Six months or so later, after being content w/one ear bud, that ear bud died. It is quite disgusting. Again, the sound is outstanding, but is not worth much if they are going to die after a year at best. So I am moving on to JLABS which have similar testimonies to this, but at least there is a semblance of customer support as people such as I myself testify to their negative experiences."
positive,"Great fan cooling, keeps things quiet and cool at load","This thing keeps my e8400 at around 50-60C at all times, even gaming. It barely kicks up speed when I'm gaming. It does pick up a bit more with video processing. This fan is capable of quite high speed and will keep your CPU in a safe range without working hard. I wish it could cool even half as well as my water cooling system, but that's fine I don't need to overclock. It also helps to increase the airflow of my system since it stands up and blows air out of the rear.The stock fan that came with my processor would be loud and buzzy when on full load gaming or mass processing. This thing is incredibly quiet in comparison.Installation is so simple. Way easier than a stock fan. This went right in without much force and stays solidly attached.Great fan especially for the price."
negative,"Flat, flat, flat","An unfortunately pedestrian and plodding little novel . Most events are summarized or told about :""I was sad."" ""I was shocked""...no real sense of character. Some effective evocations of the hajj and of daily life, but very diasappointing overall. Yes, it's told ""in the manner of 1001 Nights"",sort of, but why ? The story-telling mother is completely absent as a person."
negative,Not compatible with the v60 Phone,Received clip. Box says Compatible with Motorola L7082 L7089 120 phones. Doesn't work with my v60 phone. . .
negative,Disappointing,"I read the other reviews and, after buying this book, was deeply disappointed. It reads more like a history book and is difficult to follow. It is jumpy and not smooth in the books flow. Without knowing the area, the canyons and ridges all run together but the book is written as if everyone reading it has intimate knowledge of the area. It was also hard to keep up with all the people because, once again, the book jumps around so much.Nothing about this book flowed at all and the stories were disjointed. All in all, I was extremely disappointed with this book and would not recommend it to anyone looking for an easy reading, smooth flowing narrative of this outlaw."
negative,pedestrian,"At the risk of encountering serious bodily harm, the very young Thesiger manages to overcome many hardships and much opposition on his trek through the deserts of southern Abyssinia, but you have to read between the lines to get many thrills."
positive,ONE of the best comic book based video games,"I'll give this game 4 out of 5 because the graphics are really enhanced with the 3-D environment and The great Spidey movement animation, and the sound quality is top quality as well, but Spiderman himself doesnt quite strike me as the true comic superhero for people to look up to. Not to mention hearing Tobey Magwire narrating throughout the game gets me irritated. Like I said, this is one of the best comic based video games for one of the best superheroes, but I leave my praise as THE best to Wolverine and X2 Wolverines revenge. That being the best game for a comic superhero for more advanced video game players to appreciate. I expect the younger and less mature crowd to appreciate Spiderman and child oriented spidey games, leave Wolverine for the older players."
positive,Very functional and nice looking,"I have owned few watches from timex throughout the years and they are great. I wear my watch every day, all the time. I swim, shower, play sports with it and it holds very well. When I buy another is because I want a new look."
positive,Good Book,"This is a good book. I'm a teacher, and this book comes in handy all the time. It is an excellent resource for a teacher who needs to get thorough literary information FAST!! It's a lifesaver when making lesson plans or teaching lessons."
positive,Works great... except for draining tuna cans.,"This can opener works great and I love the smooth edges on the can and lid when you're done. My only complaint is that I like to press the lid in on my can of tuna to drain the juices -- this can opener does not cut the lid on the inside of the can, so you can't press it into the can contents."
positive,Great movie!,"Had to add this movie to my library. Great acting and plot. Francis McDormand is wonderful and unexpected as the Sheriff. William H. Macy is a train wreck. Will enjoy it over and over again,"
negative,Cracked after two uses,It is a beautiful dish but did not last. I am Very disappointed. I used this dish twice and now it has a crack half way across the bottom of the dish. I own other Portmeirion dishes and never had this problem. Maybe mine was just a lemon.
positive,Worth every penny if u have a ps3,"The game play is flawless, just like I remembered back in 1983 ( Yes I'm an 37 year old still playing video games ) Using a PS3 and a controller with this game is a must!!!! I used to be the high score champ of Dragon's Lair at the local arcade, If u are a hater then u wouldn't understand how big this game was when it first came out!! In the arcades people would line up to play at 50 cents a turn, no one knew the moves, so it could last only a minute if u suck, I invested a lot of my allowance money to finish this game. It was worth every penny!! Some people watching would even clap after the dragon was killed. GOOD TIMES TO A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD.If your an adult gamer like me then buy this game.If your too young to remember this in the arcades forget it."
negative,Boring,"This movie was so boring. It left me with unanswered questions, probably because they cut out scenes. Where they filmed this movie, the scenery was beautiful but thats pretty much it."
negative,"A lot of fluff, not a lot of detail","While this book is filled with 1000 different images, you don't get any details. What does the card look like when opened? What type of client was this project done for? Also, the images are incredibly small so you can't read any of the copy, which for some of the designs, is critical to their success. I wouldn't have bought this book had I been browsing in a store and been able to see it first."
positive,Excellent Value -- Lots of Good Movies,"This is a great value -- 250 mostly good/fun mystery ""B"" grade movies. We're finding it fun to just pick a disk and randomly put it on and watch .....for this price, and the basic age of the films, - well they're perfectly watchable -- definitely good enough and just a super bargain. I am so glad I found this set."
negative,Not for us Boomers,"If you are in your 40's or 50's as I am, have an above average IQ and appreciate music, avoid this film. Jamie Fox was impressive in an ubelievable character. Too many flaws to count; as an example expert shot Tom Cruise misses Jamie Fox in the Metro Rail shootout, yet Fox hits him. Fox uses two shots on a glass door at the office building but only one on dangerous Cruise. Most of the sound track was probably an elementary school percussion class."
positive,Monnnnnnnnnnnsterrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!,"The book ""Monster"" is whritten by Walter Dean Myers.The book is about a 16-years-old joung black boy named Steve Harmon. Steve is on trial for a murder and robbery with his gang.The shop owner was killed during a robbery they were involved in.But nobody can find out if Steve is guilty or innocent.The reader gets flashbacks and diary entries of Steve to see his emotions and feelings and that way more information than the jury.I liked to read this book because it was easy to read.Irecommend this book to teeneagers.With this book i have leran many about Stevs feelings and more information as the jury.it was very cool to read this book!!"
negative,Fan: Skip this one,"I read the reviews that wrote that Havers and Lynley were MIA in this book and the books main focus was on Deborah and Simon St. James - who are uninteresting characters in the best of times - but I refused to believe I waited like 2 years for a new Lynley George book and I got stuck with this! For shame Ms. George - to deprive your readers of one of the great mystery characters, especially a woman, to have come around in a long time. Hint: the PBS series is based on Havers and Lynley, not Deborah!!! Take my word for it George fans: skip this book as it might put you off for good!!!"
positive,Most of the big hits!,"Got this for my parents because they were seeing the band on a reunion tour. They said the song selection was very good and the sound quality was fine. For the price I paid, that's all you can ask!"
positive,My first Kinley MacGregor book...,I thought this book was fabulous. As far as the child abuse that was mentioned by a previous reviewer...the talk of it in the book was necessary to bring forward the character of the men in the story.I have read Sherrilyn Kenyon's dark hunter books and was curious to see if her writing as Kinley MacGregor was as intense and I wasn't disappointed. I will be looking for more of KM's books.
positive,Organize your clutter !!!,Anyone with a desk needs one of these. I use it to store important papers until I get time to file them....
positive,Great new artists,"I first listened to the CD after hearing about them through friends. The album consists of a good mix of sounds-I wish there were more than five songs. The music was original and the words had great meaning. As most new artists, these guys don't get enough credit- they are easily better than most bands coming out now! (Broken Record is a great song!) These guys look and sound awesome!"
positive,very good book,This is a very good informative book. I have bought at least 6 and plan to buy more at some time (to give or loan).
positive,HALBERSTAM WAS A RENAISSANCE MAN,"David Halberstam is both one of the best writers in the country and one of the best sportswriters, a rare combo. He lovingly describes the careers and retirements of Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, Johnny Pesky and Dom DiMaggio in a nostalgic manner that evokes his great love for the Boston Red Sox and the beautiful game of baseball."
negative,Bad remaster -- a complete waste of money,"Basically they increased the volume and called it a remaster. I compared tracks side by side with the original CD release.As a comparison The Beatles remaster from 2010 was excellent. Previously unheard of instruments coming through without being drowned out by ""volume""."
negative,made death seem welcome,i grabed this book wanting to read an intresting story full of twists and turns when i was done i felt like i had been beaten with a baseballbat. it drags on repeating what it has already stated. it contains nothing to set it apart from a normal piece of blank paper the only good thing i have to say or think about this book is that it makes GREAT tinder for any fireplace!!!
negative,Not good.,"Musically this album isn't actually that bad (or.. I guess what I mean is instrumentally it isn't that bad). The singer, however, is just simply not good. As someone else noted, I think I could sing better than him.Luckily I didn't buy this album, but heard it on a website. Wow... it's just not good."
negative,Critic in need of a boost.,"This book was not what I was expecting. It had moments of interesting tidbits of the people in Wilson's life, but for the most part it dragged and was boring. I wished I'd check it out of the library, so I could've saved money and returned it when I realized it wasn't as interesting as the description."
positive,The Enemy,"The audio book was fine, but this is the 2nd time I've ordered with amazon and the 2nd time I had a problem. I was sent 2 books, when I returned one of them you didn't return the shipping fees. I didn't order 2 books.Joyce"
positive,Great coffee table book,"I agree with many of the other reviewers that this book has some errors and some very odd album selections... But that is not why I like this book. It's just fun to flip through and find the next random album to buy or play. If you want resource material just use allmusic.com. If you want something entertaining to peruse and you love music, buy this book."
positive,Wow,"This movie really wraps up the main series in a way that ill probably watch it again and again until I die. If you havent seen the series, buy the srries before buying this, because doing so will cause you to miss out on a fun and romantic anime."
negative,way too dark,"Goes on easy, but turns your floors very dark. I had my kitchen floors (red oak) done with a polyurethane finish and they came out a light honey color. I did the rest of the house with Waterlox and the finish is a very dark red. Very disappointing, because I understood that Waterlox was supposed to give your floor a lighter color."
positive,Columbo,"The 1994 TV movie ""Columbo: Undercover"" is based on this book. In the movie, Columbo is substituted for several different characters from the book, alternating from scene-to-scene. Sometimes he's the book's Detective Carella, other times he takes over for Detective Brown, who also appears in the movie. As confusing as this may sound, the movie is actually a very faithful adaptation of the book - even the pieces of the photo are identical to the illustrations in the book. Fans of the book should check out the movie (which is available on DVD in the UK, but not yet in the US)."
negative,Shuts Down On High Heat,"The quiet low volume fan moves air even more gently when extra line electricity is drawn on the high heat setting and in no time instead of a warmer bathroom the safety feature shuts down the entire unit. I checked -- this is not the thermostat, even fan only will not function. Obviously the weak fan allows the higher heat setting to warm the unit itself enough trigger the safety shut down. I think this is a design flaw not an actual safety hazard. I am about to return this to Amazon and have already purchased from Amazon the DeLonghi DCH1030 which is excellent. Both fans by the way aim the hot air up sufficiently to not heat at all the surface on which they are placed -- unlike a Holmes unit I used many years but placed on a hotplate for safety."
positive,Nominated for the Arthur C. Clark Award,"Terminal Visions is an outstanding anthology showcasing fourteen short story writings of Richard Russo. The compelling selections include science fiction themes (eleven set on Earth). The themes run from alien encounters to the human condition to triumph over seemingly overwhelming conditions. Terminal Visions very nicely documents why Russo, who has won the Philip K. Dick Memorial Award and been nominated for the Arthur C. Clark Award, is considered on of the best of today's speculative fiction authors."
negative,Good Grief,"Molly must have a personal grudge with President Bush since all she seems to be able to do is find ways to bash him. Even the complements in the book are backhanded and it feels like the tone is anti-Bush.Molly has a way of telling a story to make it seem one sided, the book isn't totally unreadable but if you understand the Ivans/Bush relationship you need to read it with a grain of salt.This book would be better if you had a non-biased person writing it"
positive,Game for every family!,We have the 10 Days in Africa as well as the 10 Days in Europe and we love Them both! They are very educational for the kids and for the adults. I would highly recommend them for families with school age kids.
